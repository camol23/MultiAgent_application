    To Do
------------------------
1) Check PSO_v1 for random after intersection introduction (looks better) 

2) Unified the vis. functions



------------------------
    Done
------------------------

1) Corrections and Validation of Collision by intersection function in PSO_v2

2) Try to include a random hit when detect a intersection, in order to encourage exploration
    and avoid converge to solutions with segments with intersections 

3) collision_rect_lastCorrection Has been tested in center_box map
    a) All the intersection works 
    b) More tested is needed


-----------------------------
    Temporal Conclusions
-----------------------------
1) PSO_v2 tends to bunch the points in one area 
    a) Possible solution PSO_v3
    b) Improvement could be done with the gather penalty (not garanteed)


------------------------
    Considerations
------------------------

1) Last adjustment function (last action over Global Best Path)             |  
            a) Correction for intersection                                  | Not
            b) Create margin to the obstacle                                | Not
            c) Smooth Path                                                  | Not


    1.a) Correction for intersection
            a) Could it be possible have problems when the point get parallel in y and then
                detect intersection again, and move the point to the same x and turn the   
                second coordinate the same as the first one (x1, y1) = (x2, y2)
